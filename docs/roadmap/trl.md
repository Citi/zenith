[TRL Overview](https://github.com/finos/zenith/blob/main/primers/TRL%20Master.png)


The Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a system used to assess the maturity and readiness of technology development projects. In the context of open-source fintech, these levels can help gauge the progress and potential deployment of technological solutions. Here's a summary of the 9 levels of technology readiness:

1. TRL 1 - Basic Principles Observed: This is the lowest level, where the concept is still in the theoretical or experimental stage. In open-source fintech, it might involve initial discussions, ideas, or early research into potential solutions.
2. TRL 2 - Technology Concept Formulated: The basic concept starts to take shape. In open-source fintech, it could involve identifying specific use cases and potential technologies to address financial challenges.
3. TRL 3 - Proof of Concept Validated: In this stage, the concept is demonstrated to work in a lab or controlled environment. For open-source fintech, it might involve creating a small-scale prototype to show its feasibility.
4. TRL 4 - Technology Validated in Lab: The technology is tested and validated further in a laboratory setting. In open-source fintech, this could involve conducting more extensive testing and refinement of the initial prototype.
5. TRL 5 - Technology Validated in Relevant Environment: The technology is tested in a relevant environment, but not yet in its intended operational context. For open-source fintech, this could mean testing the technology in simulated financial scenarios or controlled financial ecosystems.
6. TRL 6 - Technology Demonstrated in Relevant Environment: The technology is demonstrated in a relevant environment close to real-world conditions. In open-source fintech, this might involve pilot projects or limited deployments to assess its effectiveness and adaptability.
7. TRL 7 - System Prototype Demonstration in Operational Environment: A system-level prototype is demonstrated in an operational environment. In open-source fintech, this stage could involve deploying the technology in a real financial setting with a limited user base.
8. TRL 8 - Actual System Completed and Qualified: The technology is now a fully functional system and is qualified for use. In open-source fintech, this stage would involve completing the open-source software, addressing security concerns, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
9. TRL 9 - Actual System Proven Through Successful Deployment: The technology has been proven through successful deployment in its intended operational environment. In open-source fintech, this would mean widespread adoption and utilization of the open-source financial technology solution.

These technology readiness levels provide a systematic approach to assess the progress and potential risks associated with the development and deployment of open-source fintech solutions. The higher the TRL level, the closer the technology is to being mature and ready for widespread adoption.
