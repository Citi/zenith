# Brain Trust Formation

By bringing together the combined might of innovation offices, labs, researchers & distinguished engineers across the FINOS membership and beyond, we seek to develop a forum of accredited and trusted subject matter experts to open discourse on current emerging technologies & their readiness levels.

## Process



1. Organisation or self-nomination of candidate based on Theoretical, Technical or Commercial experience or expertise in their discipline
2. Evaluation of subject matter expertise through evaluation of:
  a. Education & Training
  b. Shared bodies of work 
  c. Relevant skills & awards 
  d. Demonstration of professionalism & ethics 
  e. Evidence of continued professional development
3. Upon successful evaluation, an invitation will be sent to join the brain trust for the relevant discipline
4. Once you are a member of the brain trust, we will issue an accreditation to share with your network through GitHub & LinkedIn to prove your expertise
