Two papers were recently published summarizing the landscape of Quantum Computing developments in Finance. These papers help establish the common knowledge base allowing for further experimentation and use-case development that Zenith is looking to foster.<!--truncate-->

The first [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01155) provides an development overviews in portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and Monte Carlo methods for derivative pricing and risk calculation while also providing a comprehensive overview of the applications of quantum computing in the field of blockchain technology. The second [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00603-1) focuses on stochastic modelling, optimization and machine learning.
