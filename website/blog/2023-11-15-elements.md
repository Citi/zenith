[Azure Quantum Elements](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/our-story/quantum-elements-overview) is a new service that integrates the latest breakthroughs in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing to accelerate scientific discovery in chemistry and materials science. <!-- truncate -->It enables researchers to scale, speed up, and improve the accuracy of molecular simulations using cloud-based workflows, AI models, and quantum tools. Also, it provides a natural language interface called Copilot, which helps researchers generate code, query and visualize data, and initiate simulations using conversational interactions. As the name implies, is part of the Azure Quantum ecosystem, which offers quantum hardware, software, and solutions in a single cloud service. Looking at the future, it is based on Microsoftâ€™s roadmap to a quantum supercomputer, which aims to solve some of the most challenging problems in nature using a new type of stable qubit.
