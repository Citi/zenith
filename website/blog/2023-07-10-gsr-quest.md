Meta Quest Super Resolution is a new feature for VR developers that uses Qualcommâ€™s Snapdragon Game Super Resolution technology to enhance the visuals of their apps or games. <!--truncate-->It works similar to AMD's FSR, but optimized for Adreno GPU in single pass, although not as powerful as DLSS from NVidia. It is better than normal sharpening and reduces blurring and artifacts, but it also has a GPU performance cost that varies depending on the content. It is not an AI system and it has some limitations, such as not supporting YUV textures and Cube maps. It will be available in the v55 Unity Integration SDK.
