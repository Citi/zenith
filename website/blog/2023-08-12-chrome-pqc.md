Google [announced](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/enhancing-tls-security-google-adds.html) plans to add support for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms in its Chrome browser, starting with version 116.<!--truncate--> The chosen algorithm, X25519Kyber768, combines the output of X25519, an elliptic curve algorithm widely used for key agreement in TLS, and Kyber-768 to create a strong session key to encrypt TLS connections, providing roughly the security equivalent of AES-192.

While the equivalency of AES-192 may not provide a security improvement for many adopters today, the general inclusion of PQC algorithms is a welcomed improvement in what will be a multi-year adoption journey across the industry to protect user network traffic against future quantum cryptanalysis.
