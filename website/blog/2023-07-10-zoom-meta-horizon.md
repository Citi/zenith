Meta Horizon Workrooms is a virtual office space that now [integrates](https://forwork.meta.com/horizon-workrooms/integrations/) with Zoom, a widespread video conferencing tool. You can join Zoom meetings from Workrooms in VR, or add Workrooms to any Zoom call. This way, you can enjoy the features of both tools, such as screen sharing, whiteboard, sticky notes, gestures, and web chat. You can use Workrooms with or without a headset.
