One the challenges with leveraging quantum computing stems from the error-prone nature of the basic unit of quantum information, quantum bits, or qubits. By leveraging the unique properties of superposition, simultaneously existing as a state of 0 and 1, as well as entanglement, qubits enable complex computations in fields such as finance. There is a trade off however that, currently, a large amount of effort must go into quantum error correction for this to be useful.<!-- truncate -->

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is a daunting task of mitigating the sensitivity of qubits to noise in the environment. Qubits can experience errors in two dimensions: bit flips, where similarly to classical computing error the qubitâ€™s computational state flips from 1 to 0 or vice versa, and phase flips, where the different possible amplitude states may change. AWS [introduced at re:Invent 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/11/28/amazon-introduces-new-quantum-chip-to-reduce-errors) a new quantum chip where it was stated "<i>We've been able to suppress errors by 100x by using a passive error correction approach</i>".

The advancements in error rectification and the efficiency of hardware are paving the way for a future where quantum computers can tackle intricate challenges that were once thought to be beyond our reach.
