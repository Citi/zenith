Microsoft announced the public preview of Azure Remote Rendering support for Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro virtual reality headsets. <!--truncate--> Azure Remote Rendering is a service that enables developers to render high-quality interactive 3D content and stream it to devices like HoloLens 2 or desktops/laptops in real time. Azure Remote Rendering uses hybrid rendering, which combines remote content with locally rendered content, and provides an easy way to integrate the service into existing applications. Customers and partners can now use Azure Remote Rendering on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro for various use cases, such as CAD review, visualization, training, and pass-through. To get started with Azure Remote Rendering on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro, developers can follow the [updated guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/remote-rendering/) for building for Meta Quest in the documentation.
