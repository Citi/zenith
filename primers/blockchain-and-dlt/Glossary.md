- **Altcoin** (noun): initially used to refer to any cryptocurrency that wasn't Bitcoin, altcoin may now refer to any new cryptocurrency with a relatively small market cap.
- **Alts** (noun): short for altcoins.
- **Ape** (noun, verb): someone who invests heavily into a cryptocurrency or stock, or the act of doing so. This is sometimes a reaction to hype and FOMO, or done without much knowledge of the asset. It should be noted, though, that this is generally a self-assigned term and does not carry a negative connotation.
- **ATH -**** All Time High** (noun): the highest price an asset has ever had.
- **ATL - All Time Low** (noun): the lowest price an asset has ever had.
- **AR - Augmented Reality** (noun): a form of spatial computing that combines elements of virtual reality with physical reality. Currently, this is done through either wearable technology that overlays an interface onto a real-world image capture similar to a car heads up display or using glasses. Alternatively, this can also be achieved through a smartphone or computer screen (e.g., the AR features of Pok√©mon GO!)
- **Avatar** (noun): A digital representation of a human being or other entity in a virtual environment

### B

- **Bear Market** (noun): a prolonged period of decline in a financial market.
- **Bearish** (adjective): similar to a bear market, this refers to holding a pessimistic view of a market or asset's value. If you are bearish on a certain cryptocurrency, you believe its value will decrease over time. Those who are bearish may be referred to as bears.
- **Bitcoin** (noun): the very first decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital currency, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.
- **Block** (noun): a batch of transactions written to the blockchain. Every block contains information about the previous block, thus, chaining them together.
- **Blockchain** (noun): a distributed digital ledger of transactions. It is an immutable database, meaning that information cannot be tampered with or altered once it has been recorded. If there is an error in an entry, a new, revised entry must be made with both entries remaining visible on the ledger. This name derives from the fact that these transactions are recorded in 'blocks'; individual units that are linked/'chained' together in a chronological order. The blockchain becomes longer every time a new transaction is recorded. Each transaction is also assigned a timestamp, which enables users to find out exactly when it was added to the chain. The transparency and inability for users to tamper with the blockchain makes it a very reliable and trustworthy business resource for both individuals and companies who wish to transact with each other.
- **Block Explorer** (noun): a tool for browsing information on a blockchain, such as transactions, wallet addresses, market caps, and hash rates.
