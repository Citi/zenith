# Proposal to create a FINOS Emerging Technologies Special Interest Group

Proposing the creation of a FINOS Emerging Technologies Special Interest Group (Zenith). The purpose of the Zenith SIG would be to explore and promote the adoption of new and innovative technologies in the financial services industry. The proposed goals of the SIG are to:
1. identify and evaluate emerging technologies that have potential to transform the sector 
2. to share best practices, use cases, and insights for the broader community in the form of webinars, podcasts, and articles.

To gather interest and commitment, FINOS is organizing an initial exploratory meeting - which will also help to prepare for the SIG approval submission (to FINOS Board of Directors) - on Wednesday 29th of March at 10:00 US/Eastern. Agendas and conference info can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/finos-labs/emerging-technologies/issues).
